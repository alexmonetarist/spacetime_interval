# Spacetime_interval

A Python program to calculate a linear spacetime interval. The program takes in two points, $(t_1, x_2)$ & $(t_2, x_2)$, and applies the spacetime interval formula. 


## Requirements
The program uses the numpy library for mathematical operations and matplotlib to visualize the results. In order to run this program, you will need to have the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries installed in your Python environment. You can install these dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please make sure you have the latest version of pip installed and you're running the command in the same directory as the requirements.txt file.You can also install the dependencies manually by running the following command:
